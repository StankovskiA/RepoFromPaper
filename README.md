# Linking papers with their corresponding tools

## Overview

The Research Paper Linkage Project is a research initiative focused on developing a methodology for the efficient extraction and linkage of GitHub repositories and tools mentioned in academic research papers. The primary objective of this project is to create a robust pipeline for the automatic detection, analysis, and, where relevant, linking of these repositories and tools to their respective research papers. By achieving this, we aim to streamline the process of accessing and referencing the code and tools associated with academic work.

## Project Goals

- Develop an efficient methodology for extracting links to GitHub repositories and tools from research papers.
- Implement a pipeline for the automatic detection of URLs, analysis, and linking to the referenced research papers.
- Address challenges such as accurate link extraction using PDF-to-Text tools, differentiation between proposed, reused, and mentioned tools, and recognition of various expressions used to refer to tools and repositories, including the identification and linking of synonyms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Research Paper Linkage Project, follow these steps:
